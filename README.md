# Hangman
In this project, I am re-creating the famous game of Hangman. For those of you who don't know, Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attenpts, guessing a letter at a time. This project is an implementation of this, where the computer generates a word at random and the user tries to guess it.

## Milestone 1
Some technologies used in thie making of this game are Python, Git, GitHub, random import, user input, if, elif and els statements, while and for loops, functions, classes and methods.c

## Milestone 2
I started by using some basics in Python to create a list of words and using the 'random' package to select a word at random from this list for the user to guess.
I then used the input function to ask the user to guess a letter.

Following this, I created an 'if' statement to ensure the guess was valid. For example, a number, character or two letters would not be valid guesses. One single alphabetical letter would class as a valid guess. I did this by ensuring the guess was == 1 character and by using the .isalpha() function.
